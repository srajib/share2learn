UPDATED_SUCCESSFULLY=<div><h1>AiDaNews Module for K2 v1.1.1</h1><p align="center"><img src="../modules/mod_aidanews_for_K2/logo.png" border="0" alt="Logo" /></p><br/> AiDaNews for K2 is the K2 adaptation of the AiDaNews Latest News Module. It is completely integrated with <a href="http://getk2.org/" title="Get K2!">K2</a>. <b>This module will only work if K2 is installed - get the <a href="http://extensions.joomla.org/extensions/news-display/latest-news/11652" title="Get AiDaNews!">AiDaNews module</a> if you want to use it on Joomla's com_content or FLEXIcontent. </b><br /> The AiDaNews Module has been created with flexibility in mind: not only it will let you choose <b>what</b> you want to display, but also <b>how</b> to display it! This thanks to custom styling options that can be changed directly from the backend of the module, with no need to actually turn your FTP client on and manually change CSS files.<br />Anything, from items ordering method to article image position, can be easily set from the backend. Don't think this great number of options will lead you to confusion, though!Thanks to explanatory descriptions and the accordion-like sorting method, finding the option you need will be quick and easy!<br/><br/>Full Changelog <a href="../modules/mod_aidanews/Changelog.txt">HERE</a> - Module's structure <a href="../modules/mod_aidanews/AiDaNewsstructure.jpg">HERE</a> - Date format Help <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.strftime.php">HERE</a><br/>Get new versions, submit feature requests and ask fixes for bugs <a href="http://www.aimini.it">HERE</a>.<br/>Feel free to send me an e-mail (dan@cdh.it) [Write in English or Italian please!] to show me your website where AiDaNews for K2 have been used, to request support or for any other need!</div>
